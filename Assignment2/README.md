# COMP 303 Assignment 2 (Insertion Sort Using MIPS Assembly)

A MIPS Assembly program that sorts an array using the insertion sort algorithm, removes the duplicates (if there are any) from that array, and finally sums over all elements of the resulting array was implemented for this project. Length and elements of the array are taken as inputs from the user.

## Taking Inputs from the User

Inputs are taken from the user by a certain syntax. 

In order to define the length of the array, the user should enter
'''bash
-n 10
''' 
to the command line.
